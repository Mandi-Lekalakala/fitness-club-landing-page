📖 Project Overview
</br>
<p>
This project is a responsive fitness club landing page built early in my front-end journey to practice layout, styling, and user interaction. The design was inspired by a well-known South African fitness brand and focuses on recreating a clean, modern interface commonly used in fitness and lifestyle websites.
The project was created to strengthen my understanding of CSS layout techniques and JavaScript-driven interactivity in a real-world style layout.
